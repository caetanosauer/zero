# Since updates to these require atomic instructions, which are
# expensive, we prefer to update per-thread statistics, then
# collect them into the summary stats, which happens
# 1) when an smthread is destroyed, and 
# 2) when the thread is running an instrument transaction, and
#    it detaches that transaction (in which case, the per-thread
#    stats are cleared so they don't get double-counted).
#  
# Counters that we absolutely want to keep, whether or not transactions
# are instrumented, go here.
#
# NOTE: an xct is instrumented iff it has an allocated sm_stats_info_t, which
# contains a copy of *all* sm stats, including the TODO CLEAN THIS UP
